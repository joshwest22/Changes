        <li id="#Q1">What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and the data discussed in chapter 8?</li>
            <p>This chapter emphasized using multiple graphs to show various aspects (trend, seasonality, and noise) rather than one graph to show the central tendency of all of the data.</p>
        <li id="#Q2">What are the pro's and cons of 3 visualizations techniques discussed in chapter 8?</li>
        <div class="div1">
        <p>Below is a table showing the pros and cons of 3 visualization techniques</p>
            <table>
            <th></th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th>
            <tr><th>Moving Average</th><td>Helps put the trend aside to explore other aspects of the data</td><td>Can be confusing if there is a moving average and other dynamic data</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Seasonal Subseries Chart</th><td>Helps compare between time periods</td><td>Ommitted data can cause an inaccurate representation of this data</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Horizon Chart</th><td>Makes it easy to visualize gradient of increase or decrease in a small graphic</td><td>Can be confusing if you have never encountered this graph before</td></tr>

            <table>
            <th></th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th>
            <tr><th>Trend</th><td>Helps show which direction a pattern is going</td><td>Is easily miseleading and can cause mix effects</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Seasonality</th><td>Helps provide context of thhe past and current occurences and can shed light on future ones</td><td>Data that is left out can lead to skewed seasonality and trend</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Noise</th><td>Reducing the noise can often more clearly reveal patterns in data</td><td>Reducing the noise can also oversimplify data and cause faulty assumptions to be made</td></tr>
